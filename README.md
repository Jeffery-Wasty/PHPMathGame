This project reuqired students to make a 'math game' that would present users with either an addition or subtraction question, ask for input, and record the number of correct guesses the user has made, as well as the total questions answered by the user (their score). To access the game users had to 'log in' using pre-defined credentials (found in 'credentials.config'). The project used HTML, CSS, and PHP, but mainly PHP the login information had to be passed to an authenticate page via $POST, and user score, and total questions asked were recorded with session variables, with the session being destroyed when the user logged out.
